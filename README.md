<h1>Venus_Lite</h1>

Venus_Lite is a simplified version of Venus, an implementation of the Filecoin Distributed Storage Network. For more details about Filecoin, check out the [Filecoin Spec](https://spec.filecoin.io).

## Building & Documentation

For instructions on how to build, install and join a venus storage pool, please visit [here](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/Using-venus-Shared-Modules.html).

## Venus architecture

With key features like security, ease of use and distributed storage pool, the deployment of a node using Venus is quite different from the one using [Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus). Details of mining architecture can be found [here](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/#how-venus-works).

## Related modules

Venus loosely describes a collection of modules that work together to realize a fully featured Filecoin implementation. List of stand-alone venus modules repos can ben found [here](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/Using-venus-Shared-Modules.html#introducing-venus-modules), each assuming different roles in the functioning of Filecoin.
